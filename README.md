# AlarmClock
MVVM based C# application for creating and setting alarms for different users.

## How to use
To run the application - just clone the repository itself and run through Visual Studio.
After starting the application, you have to log in with your own data or create a new account. 
After the registration procedure, private cabinet appears where user can set alarm clocks.

| Buttons | Usage |
|---|---|
| â†‘ | Scroll(for choosing new time and edit added time) hours/minutes up |
| â†“ | Scroll hours/minutes dowm (for choosing new time and edit added time) |
| + | Add new clock |
| ðŸ”” | Ring bell |
| â•³ | Delete ring |
| ðŸšª | log out |

If the add button has a gray color, it means that the list of alarms already has the alarm for the same time amd it is impossible to add another one.
The same situation comes when you editing some alarm clock and set to it time that appear in another clock and you must change it.

If you want to start alarm clock ringing manually - you have to click on the bell icon to the right of the time and it will blink until 2 minutes pass or don't press the button again.
